## About This Repository

After I lost my hard disk — along with a ton of my personal projects (RIP 😢) — I decided to move things online. So here it is: a little safe haven for some of my own C# and .NET experiments, projects, and ideas.

### 🛒 Online Shop Plattform

This was my ambitious attempt at creating a fully functional online shop web app using **Blazor** and **ASP.NET Web API**.  
Spoiler alert: I didn’t finish it.

Why? Well... let’s just say building an online shop from scratch is like trying to tame a dragon with spaghetti code — it's complex, time-consuming, and slightly terrifying. So I decided to park it for now (might come back to it when I feel brave again).

### ✍️ Personal Blog

Here, I went the **C# + ASP.NET MVC** route, using **Entity Framework Core** for data access and management. This is a blog platform where I played around with creating and managing entries via a web interface — clean, structured, and a nice playground for sharpening my MVC skills.

### 📝 Notes App

A small but fun **MAUI** app written in C#. This project was all about managing my daily notes. Think of it as my personal digital notepad — lightweight, mobile-friendly, and a way for me to get comfy with **MAUI UI** and cross-platform development.

### 📝 Personal Expense Tracker
A basic WPF app in c# using MVVM Pattern.
